# Arbitrium 
This was a project that was co-created at the university, by me and my friend, it was not a course project, this born because the administrator of the library, where are around 120 computers, they use a free to limited program to control all the computers and students behaviour, we know that and check other free posibilities and finally after found anything, we create a program focused on the neccesities of the library, there is when Arbitrium born.

This branch is just for backing up the nostalgia of creating a program like this from scratch, without any real knowledge of the professional world. Iâ€™m uploading it to a backup branch on GitHub, and then I plan to improve it with my current knowledge.
